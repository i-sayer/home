    <h2>Scala files</h2>
    <p>From the <a href="http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/">Scala home page</a>...</p>
    <blockquote>Scala is a powerful software tool for experimentation with musical tunings, such as just intonation scales, equal and historical temperaments, microtonal and macrotonal scales, and non-Western scales.</blockquote>
    <p>The scala application can retune midi instruments using pitch bender messages but for the G2, this will only work with monophonic patches.</p>
    <p>While the G2 has no native support for scala files, a patch has been produced that allows for arbitrary returning of up to 96 notes within a polyphonic patch.
        The scala utility in this app can read scl files and directly adjust settings in the G2 scala patch template.
    </p>
	<p>The scl file contains definitions for alternate tuning. For example</p>
    <pre>

	<p>This app is intended as a replacement for the bare bones python version and will allow selecting up to eight scala files per patch.</p>
	
	<p>Kbm (keyboard mapping) files are also supported, each scl file can have a kbm file associated with it. The app allows for the root key
         to be changed from the default Middle C, or the map file override. The selected note becomes the new root note (no tuning applied) while the octave is
        combined with any retuning specified in the map file.</p>
